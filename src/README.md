# About
This directory contains the source code for a wrapper around the sensor calibration routines along with patches to the code to enable it to operate standalone and to read sensor data and calibration constants from a file.

The original source code by Bosch was provided in [BME680_driver](https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BME680_driver.git), which is no longer available. It has been replaced by [Bosch-BME68x-Library](https://github.com/boschsensortec/Bosch-BME68x-Library).
